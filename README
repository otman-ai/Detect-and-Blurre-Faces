# Image Blurring

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for blurring faces and license plates in images and live video streams using OpenCV, YOLO object detection, and face recognition.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv_name
```

```bash
venv_name\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS and Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_name
```

```bash
source venv_name/bin/activate
```

After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ultralytics
```

```bash
pip install face-recognition
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python gui.py
```

### Image Processing

1. Click on the "Open Image" button.
2. Select an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG) using the file dialog.
3. The image will open, and you will see checkboxes for "Face" and "License Plate".
4. Select the objects you want to blur (you can choose "Face", "License Plate", or both).
5. Click on the "Blur Image" button.
6. The image with the blurred objects will be displayed in a new window.

### Live Video Processing

1. Click on the "Open Live Stream" button.
2. The live video stream from your default camera will start.
3. You will see checkboxes for "Face" and "License Plate".
4. Select the objects you want to blur (you can choose "Face", "License Plate", or both).
5. The live video stream will show the processed frames with the selected objects blurred.
6. To stop the process, press the "q" key.

### Video Stream Processing

1. Click on the "Open Video Stream" button.
2. Select a video file (MP4 format) using the file dialog.
3. The video will start playing, and you will see checkboxes for "Face" and "License Plate".
4. Select the objects you want to blur (you can choose "Face", "License Plate", or both).
5. The video will continue playing, and the selected objects will be blurred in each frame.
6. To stop the process, press the "q" key.
